## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting lead conversion rates for an Edu-Tech company. By building machine learning models, the goal is to identify leads with the highest potential for conversion, enabling the company to allocate resources effectively and enhance its lead management process.

## Data
- The dataset contains information about leads, their activity, and preferences.
- Features include lead source, total visits, total time spent on the website, last activity, and more.
- The target variable is "Converted," indicating whether a lead successfully converted or not.

## Usage
- This project can assist the Edu-Tech company in prioritizing leads with the highest conversion potential.
- It offers insights into which leads are more likely to generate revenue and how marketing and sales strategies can be tailored accordingly.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Model Selection
- Model Evaluation and Metrics
- Lead Scoring and Prioritization
- Recommendations for Improving Conversion Rates

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository.
- Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (requirements.txt).
- Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
- Train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Model Selection
We used a range of machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting


## Evaluation
- We evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
- Model performance is discussed in the project results section.

## Results
- Model performance metrics: (Provide actual performance metrics here, e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Insights into key factors influencing lead conversion.
- Recommendations for optimizing marketing and sales efforts.

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
- Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.
